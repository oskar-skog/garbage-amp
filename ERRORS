Pinout for voltage regulator is wrong.  I thought it was the same as for a 78xx,
but oops.

Voltage regulator (7912) broken, replacement needs to be installed.
Will not work with batteries until fixed.  Note the incorrect pinout on the
PCB, bend wires to compensate.

R3 (100 kOhm trimpot) failed open.  As a quick fix, it has been shorted.
Input impedance is much lower than wanted.

A shortsight with the selection of R7 and C2 causes the amplifier to take a
very long time to stabilize.  Be patient or short R7 if the amplifier has been
turned off for a long time.

Voltage good indicator for batteries not working.  Possible reasons:
    - Fried zeners
    - Zeners too non-ideal
    - Voltage drop on LED higher than expected
